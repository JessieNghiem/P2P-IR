Text review: I love Port of Subs, and discovered this one near my new job that I started this week. I like it here for a few different reasons, and they have a lot going for them.  I noticed a few low reviews, but wanted to chime in and give my two cents as to how much I like it here.

For starters, they have two lines, which really helps since it seems to be in a busy part of town. There's a lot of business's around and it's close to the airport so I'm sure they get a lot of foot traffic going in and out.  I like that they have two service lines, so there's literally no wait here for getting your food in a short amount of time.  The staff here has been really nice, and seem to get my order out quickly.

The downside? For starters, the drink station was kinda dirty today, and even though there was a staff member there when I went to refill my drink, she didn't seem to try to clean up the watery mess from someone who must have made a mess between the time I got my first drink and the 15 minutes later when I went to go refill my cup. It appeared that someone splashed a bunch of water all over the counter or ice cubes had been spilled and melted and caused a bit off a pool of water.  It was somewhat disarming since I was in work clothes and didn't want to get stains on my shirt, and I had a book with me and really didn't want to get that wet either.  

They seem to get a lot of repeat business here since it is in somewhat of a business district. I know they do a punch card system, and I didn't think about it until much later in the day and wish a staff member had said something. I guess they must not be big on enforcing it? Seems like other business's are jamming punch cards down my throat to get me back in the door, but not this port of subs.

Overall a good experience and I'm sure I'll be back in the future.

Text review: My favorite sammy restaurant chain of all time. I always get the #5 on sourdough... MMM MMM MMM. Great customer service there, only downer is the outdated interior... always a To Go order when ordering from the Boulder Hwy. location. But they are doin' something right! It's always pretty busy in there!

Text review: I ordered a 12" sub, asked to get it toasted and they put it in panini press. It was so thin I couldve put it in my wallet! Plus the have  a limited variety of veggies. Total $8! worst $8 I ever spent, never going back! I took pics of this crappy sandwich wish I could post them.
