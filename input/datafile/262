My hubby loves Port of Subs, so we eat at them regularly all over town, whenever he gets the craving.  Some are yucky, some average, but this location was just lovely.  The staff at this location was extremely nice, the store was spotless, and the service was super fast.  The trifecta of fast food places, right?\n\nI am boring and always get the #1. I call it the Italian meat buffet because it is loaded with pepperoni, salami, capicolla, ham, and provolone on bread and it is fantastic.  I am drooling just thinking about it!  I am kind of anti-veggie, so I go with just the meat, cheese, extra mustard/mayo spread, and all of the seasonings.  It is tasty!\n\nI like how everything is sliced fresh for your order.  The veggies, even though I don't eat them, all look fresh and much nicer than the veggies at Subway.  The bread is always flaky and fresh and tastes great.  They always have a huge selection of sides as well.  I am just happy with my jalape√±o chips though and really haven't tried the other items.  My hubby likes their cookies and brownies though and he gets at least 1 every time we are there.\n\nOverall if you want a sandwich quick, this is a great location to grab one and go.","user_id":28}

The veggie toppings weren't as fresh. There was no lid on the mayo or mustard and salads (mac, potato and tuna salad) which makes it build a \"crust\" where it oxidized. Overall sandwich was just okay.\n\nFor the price, and especially since Subway is across the street- I don't know how they make business.

Hot and cold. I prefer cold and they make them just fine. I would say the sandwiches are not soggie like Subway's gets to be. Quiznos bread to me is a bit better. Smoothies are also quite good for the price. Prices are reasonable.\n\n\nSETTING\nThis is a typical corner sandwich shop. Tables are clean, the place is well lit and it doesn't feel crowded\n\nSERVICE\nAlways good and patient even if you somehow manage to forget what you were about to order. If you are a regular, your sandwich might even be made without you saying anything.\n\nOVERALL\nGood place to have lunch. Getting every 12th sandwich for free as part of their loyalty \"eater\" program makes it that much better.","user_id":77}

I was expecting a low-end Subway (which I don't really enjoy in the first place), so imagine my delight when I found out that they have warm sandwiches in addition to subs, and in addition to warm sandwiches, they have wraps [insert pun joke here]! I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork wrap, and was excited to find that one of the things that they do have in common with Subway is the \"choose your own toppings\" option. I'm pretty simple when it comes to my sandwiches, so this is an appealing feature for me. I ordered it with onions and pepperjack cheese, and after they'd tossed it on the grill I paid up and sat down to enjoy. And oh, did I enjoy! That wrap didn't stand a chance...after the first bite I was sold. I would have downed it much more quickly than I did if I hadn't been with a coworker that I didn't know super well...no use giving her the impression that I'm a total pig. \n\nI wouldn't say it was dirt cheap, but $9.36 for a wrap, a bag of chips and a soda isn't overly expensive, either, and it was WELL worth it. I highly recommend this place, a) because they give you options and b) because their food is yummy...or at least the pulled pork is! \n\nI see from Russell S.'s review that this place is, in fact, a chain, but since I am not a Phoenix native and therefore have been left to form an opinion of this place all on my own without any pre-disposed bias (no offense, Russell...it happens to the best of us), I'm inclined to give this place 2 thumbs up (read: 4 stars)...hopefully, I'll be back!","user_id":53}

So I walk in at about 7pm on a Sunday; the lights were on, \"open\" sign blazing, and the guy behind the counter asked me \"What can I get for you?\"  So, the idiot that I am, I assumed they were open for business.\n\nEvidently not.  I wasn't eyeballing the counter too hard so I didn't notice that they had put the bread and such away until he very laboriously dragged it back out.  He sighed and scowled at me the entire time, and was sarcastic and rude whenever he spoke.  He made it extremely clear that he wanted me out of his shop and wished that I hadn't come in.  It was also made clear to me that they had to re-open the register for my order.\n\nI've worked in a shop before, and I really did feel guilty.  I know what it's like to have people come in just before closing, but I've never treated a customer that badly just for some last minute business.  But the kicker is that it was 2 hours before posted closing time, and they hadn't bothered to turn off the sign OR lock the door, even though they had apparently shut down the register.  I'm not a mind reader; I don't know you're closing 2 hours early unless I'm told.  He could have easily said \"sorry, we've just closed\" and I would have said \"oh sorry dude\" and walked out, no problem.  Though I was getting sandwiches for my parents, I'm sure they could have lived with something else.  With the same ingredients, I can make better ones at home.  I'm glad I wasn't getting anything for myself, because after the way this man treated me I doubt I would have wanted to eat it.\n\nI don't know why they happened to be closing early, and I don't care.  I just wish the older gent that \"served\" me had been honest and said they'd closed instead of using his precious five minutes to treat me like a rat turd in his lentil soup.\n\nNeedless to say, I've been put off and I doubt I'll go back.","user_id":32}

My friend got an 8\" something on sour dough. We added chips and a drink to both. The sandwiches were big with a fair amount of meat and cheese. Plenty of veggies. Everything was fresh and tasty. The downside was the limited choice of condiments. Nothing lite or low calorie other than plain yellow mustard. I went with the mustard. Ended up with way too much, and it was very strong. The other thing is there was just way too much bread. I took the top bun off and solved both problems.\n\nWe got there at the tail end of lunch. There was a small line, but it moved quickly.

One, I do not understand paying the exact same for a sandwich because their options vary in meat selection and non-meat selections. A turkey and provolone should not cost the same as a meat stuffed with 4-5 different meats. Just sayin. And two, which is my biggest criticism, is they are ONLY OPEN UNTIL 5PM?!?!?! What kind of crap is that?!?! How much business is this place losing by closing so early? I came here for dinner once and was shooed away at the door at 4:59PM. Wow.\n\nAll in all, this place is good and would recommend. Their meat and cheeses are sliced fresh every order and I do like the fact there are 2 separate counters for ordering.

It's next to Papa John's so when you see that, turn into the complex with Staples.  It's minutes from work so I am somewhat of a regular here. Will keep coming back because it's yummy!","user_id":52}

I imagine the fresh cut meat helped... or at least gave the illusion of helping!\n\nAs to this one... well, I asked for \"the works\" on my sub... twice, getting a confused look both times, before I waved my hand in front of the case indicating everything. After this point I was informed that the sandwich maker had \"never heard that before.\" Alright that's not so bad in itself. But my co-worker ordered a chicken salad... and the chicken was immediately stuck in the microwave; then a couple minutes later, he was asked if he wanted it hot or cold. When he said that he would have preferred cold, they pulled another bucket of chicken out only to realize that they store their chicken frozen.

I usually get #6-vegetarian.  You have a choice of three cheeses, but I always get triple Provolone. The bread they bake tastes really good and doesn't flake when I eat, unlike another major sandwich chain.  It's not dry either and I don't feel like I need to wash the particles down with a drink. \n\nPort of Subs is right down the street from where I work, which is perfect because they are quick and always have a smile.  Employees are always helpful and help me out when I make a lunch run for the office.  I always ask if I can hand them the post-its of orders and not once have they rolled their eyes.  They take them all, stick them on the counter and begin making the sandwiches.  When they're done, they will mark the wrapper with an initial or something for easy identifying. \n\nI just love coming here. Sandwiches are made tasty by friendly employees.  Plus, coupons arrive in the mail frequently and I can use my student ID at this location to get a small combo for $5.49.  Not bad for a student on a budget!","user_id":20}

That's ok but if you are not eating in, the lettuce spills out of the sandwich and in your lap/car/keyboard/tv remote/whatever is beneath your mouth.\n\nIt's a busy store, the guys that run it have been there a few years which is a good thing and everyone was looking happy as they dug themselves out of the shredded lettuce and finished their lunches. \n\nGood option for lunch in North Summerlin.","user_id":30}

My impression was that the sandwich was like a panini, as it looked in the pictures (they did use a panini press, but they use the same bread they do for the subs, so it didn't get the nice little crunch you get with a panini). I chose smoked cheddar for the cheese, and then asked if they could put some tomato on the sandwich as well. The young lady said she would get the toppings I wanted in a moment, at which time she grilled the sandwich. After she grilled it, she brought it over and asked what I wanted to add to it. I asked for tomato and pepper. She split the sandwich back open and added what I asked for. I would've preferred the tomatoes to be warm like the rest of the ingredients, but they made the sandwich lukewarm when I started eating it. The sandwich was pretty tasty, I should've had a little hot sauce or something though to add a little zing to it. If you've never had it, give it a try. I ordered a Medium, which was 8\", and it was five bucks. Not a bad deal at all.","user_id":51}

It's like Subway's more polished older brother.  The bread is much better, the meat tastes fresher, and I think you get more food (although maybe it costs more - it's been a while since I've been to Subway now!)\n\nThis particular Port of Subs has nice staff and a great atmosphere. When I order from them online they do a great job putting the order together.  Just like Subway, you tell them what you want and they make the sandwich in front of you. They slice the meat fresh, which makes a difference,  If you order the sandwich grilled, they stick it in a little panini-like grill thingie, (which really doesn't do much more than put lines on the bread).  They only offer like 3 kinds of bread, but since Subway seems to always be out of the breads I want, Port of Subs is probably smart to stick to a few choices. Stick to a few things and do it well, I say.  I'm a fan!","user_id":30}

OMG this place rocks!  Everything here is fresh on site.  The bread is cooked and fresh, and they have white, wheat and Sourdough.  They have 3 sized subs, and a menu a mile long.  They have 18 cold subs to choose from, and some hot subs to choose as well.\n\nThey cut the meat as you order your sandwich. Not predone like other lame chains that shall go unnamed.\n\nI usually get a #18, which is Roast Beef and Turkey with cheese.  mmmm, tasty.  I usually order a really big sub, eat half there, and take the other half home to eat for later.  I like it here because I really feel like I get a lot of food for my money.\n\nThere are two reasons why I gave them 4 stars.  First, this location has really crappy hours.  They close early, and sometimes, I can't get to them before they close.  I think they close at like 6PM or something.  booo!  Who are you catering to with this schedule?  I think they should be open until at least 8 PM.  so, points lost for crappy hours.\n\nThe other thing I am docking them for, was I had a bad service experience there today.  There were 3 people working behind the counter that I could see.  One girl slicing meat, one guy running the register, and a third guy doing stock and stuff with bread in the oven.\n\nWell, since I got the combo meal which includes a beverage and chips, I went to the chip area and it looked pretty hit and wiped out.  The only chips left were the crappy flavors that I do not like.  I want plain chips, thats all.  I didnt want jalapeno (stomach doesnt like it) nor did I want the Dill flavored either.  I asked the gentleman who was doing bread and stock if he had any plain chips available.  He was rather snappy with me and said \"if we had them, they would be out there.  Whatever we have is on the shelf.\"  He quickly blew me off, and I was aggrivated.  He told me to look at the other chip stand to see if I could find what I was looking for. \n\nFortunately, I got my plain chips, but nothing irriates me more then the annoying response of \"If we had it, it would be out there.\"  Bullsh!t! Your just to lazy to go look.  I know you have cases of chips in the back, so stop stocking your cups and get me some chips.\n\nAside from the snotty stocker guy, the other two people working there were wonderful.   The register guy wrapped one half of my sandwich for me to go, and served the other one for me to stay and eat in the resturant.","user_id":11}
