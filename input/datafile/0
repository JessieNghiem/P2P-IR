Port of Subs food has a great fresh taste that will blow any Subway away.  However, this particular location tastes even better than any other Port of Subs I've been to!   I order my usual #18 Roast Beef, Turkey and Provolone on wheat and am never disappointed in the years I have been coming here.  I think that what really makes this location stand out from others is the service which is impeccable!  The owner Damon I swear is always here working each time I come in.  I am pretty sure he lives at the shop or at the very least never takes a day off.  I always find him behind the counter making sandwiches and chatting it up with patrons.  Always, always has a smile on his face and may be the nicest guy in the business.  I have to attribute the quality of this location that includes the taste of the food, the always clean dining area and the suburb level of service I get to this guy's managerial style and hustle.

I could eat here and never get sick of the food or the menu items. But, the service here on Sunday left me upset, sad and slightly irritated and annoyed! I've never been to this specific location, but on Sunday I wanted to take some friends on the light rail and then go here for lunch while the weather was still comfortable and nice.\n\nI know this place is near campus, and they probably get a lot of student riff raff, but I was a bit annoyed with the service that I recieved here.  Actually, I'm still bothered almost a day later.  I will attribute it to the fact that its students that were working here behind the counter.\n\nAnyways, for starters, I called here before hand to ask a few location questions.  These girls had NO idea where they were located.  Really, they didn't.  They couldn't tell me not only where they were close to, but had NO idea how far from the light rail they were.  I knew where she was better then she did!  I told her which one of the two stops would be closer for me to deboard at, and she had no clue.  I had to get out my light rail map at home to figure out where they were.  She was totally useless!  I only knew where to go because she told me she was near smashburger...and I figured out where to go from there.\n\nSo friends and I take the light rail down to the College/Veterans Way exit.  We walk to the port of subs and I realize that I have to go to the bathroom.  I was mentioning it to my friends as we walked into the store, and out of no where, some girl at a table boasts out \"WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC BATHROOMS IF YOU NEED TO GO YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AT SUBWAY BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING.\"  Um, I wasn't only NOT talking to her, but the fact that she took it upon herself to YELL it at me as I'm setting foot in the store is a whole different story.  I was SO annoyed!\n\nI mentioned to the service girl who was on break eating a sub that I wasn't addressing her about my bathroom concerns she responded with \"Well, I couldn't help but hear you when you came in.\"  REALLY?!?!?!

There's some good people watching to be done here - cops eat here, firemen eat here, doctors and nurses eat here, and you also get the entire spectrum of downtown Scottsdale folk... sometimes you would think you arrived at a costume party or they are filming a new Village People video. I don't know what it is and I don't know that it matters either, but good looking people eat here. Whatever you want to make of that... \n\nMost of the people that work here are really nice and competent. They keep this place pretty clean as well. Once I noticed some fruit flies buzzing around by the soda machine and was told they sometimes come with the fresh fruit they get for the smoothies (which are fantastic). Outside of that, I can't complain about this sub shop and I eat here all the time... it's almost just about as good as a non-chain place.","user_id":44}

Both my boyfriend and I have been skimped on veggies so many times, and it's really a frustrating issue when it happens on so many occasions.

I like it here for a few different reasons, and they have a lot going for them.  I noticed a few low reviews, but wanted to chime in and give my two cents as to how much I like it here.\n\nFor starters, they have two lines, which really helps since it seems to be in a busy part of town. There's a lot of business's around and it's close to the airport so I'm sure they get a lot of foot traffic going in and out.  I like that they have two service lines, so there's literally no wait here for getting your food in a short amount of time.  The staff here has been really nice, and seem to get my order out quickly.\n\nThe downside? For starters, the drink station was kinda dirty today, and even though there was a staff member there when I went to refill my drink, she didn't seem to try to clean up the watery mess from someone who must have made a mess between the time I got my first drink and the 15 minutes later when I went to go refill my cup. It appeared that someone splashed a bunch of water all over the counter or ice cubes had been spilled and melted and caused a bit off a pool of water.  It was somewhat disarming since I was in work clothes and didn't want to get stains on my shirt, and I had a book with me and really didn't want to get that wet either.  \n\nThey seem to get a lot of repeat business here since it is in somewhat of a business district. I know they do a punch card system, and I didn't think about it until much later in the day and wish a staff member had said something. I guess they must not be big on enforcing it? Seems like other business's are jamming punch cards down my throat to get me back in the door, but not this port of subs.\n\nOverall a good experience and I'm sure I'll be back in the future.","user_id":52}

I'm originally from Jersey, and I don't know why, but I like ketchup on my cheesesteaks. It was OK though ~ since the rest was so good.\n\nMy buddy liked his pastrami on swiss, commenting that he doesn't like rye bread, so he liked the fact that he could get his pastrami on a plain old white roll.\n\nOh, also, they had one of those new digital Gold Peak iced tea machines and served Coke Zero.

I love 'em. They're so quintessential to American everyday life so I love having a lot of options of sandwich places where I live. \n\nPort of Subs has been a favorite of mine since college. My first big time crush/love worked at Port of Subs for many years so it was always good for me to go out of my way to get my sandwiches at POS.\n\nThis one is okay. As it is the closest to my house it is the one I go to normally. The staff here is really young, gotta be high school students. Not that that's a bad thing, but sometimes when I walk in here I get the vibe that says: \"WHAT are you doing here? WE don't want to actually work!\" Yah. And then you gotta order your sandwich from an angry little teenager and watch them to make sure it gets made how you want it. Which is not a problem because you do get to watch them make it - I love that. Especially since you can just easily ask \"Hey can I get a few more pickles?\" \n\nI like their mayo/mustard combo and the fact that they slice the meat right there before putting it on your sandwich. Usually I get a #5 (turkey, ham, smoked cheddar), but yesterday I got the #3 (turkey, salami, cheddar). Typically I don't go for the salami-type meats, but it turned out pretty good! The reason I ended up getting that sandwich was because I said \"I want a number 3, er I meant 5\", but apparently the lady did not hear my correction. Oh well, her mistake kind of made my day, because I got to try a new sandwich and I liked it! However, still kind of bad that she wasn't listening to me enough to hear me correct myself.\n\nOh well, all in all I like POS. If you go here often make sure to get their stamp card so you can eventually get a free sandwich!","user_id":54}

I had a old school stamp card from 2005 that I found in my desk and this location still took it even though they haven't used that rewards program in a while.

I didn't expect him to take it but thought it was worth a try so it ended up working out and I gave him a tip.  \n\nThe sandwich I ordered and always order is the #1 and that has ham, salami, capicolla, pepperoni & provolone cheese on my choice of white bread. of course I have to add my toppings like mustard, mayo, onion yadda yadda.

Came here for a couple sandwiches on a Saturday evening. There were two workers, a guy and a girl. The guy was talking to himself while making the sandwiches. The girl came from out of the back to help. My order could not be completed as requested as the guy said they only had two slices of American cheese. He put the two slices back from where he took them after putting them on the sandwich.\n\nAs the girl was putting lettuce on the sandwiches she must have put 3 full cups on each. The guy and her were having an extremely difficult time making and finishing these sandwiches. We were the only 2 customers in the building. I finally had to ask the guy if the two of them were baked or on drugs. He got defensive and hostile, but it seemed that he was expecting it. \n\nFinally, upon checking out I told the girl I wanted the receipt. She made a motion as if she had put it in the bag, then switched it to her other hand and put it on the left side of the register. I looked in the bag when I picked it up and said I don't see a receipt in here. She proceeded to frantically do a reprint of the receipt. It did not have the cashier name or proof that the transaction was paid by our credit card. I assume that this fiasco was an attempt to keep us from complaining. I would have let it go and left it as an amusing side show had the girl not tried to dupe me with the receipt.\n\nIn addition, it did not look like the containers were labeled and dated for freshness. The two did not know how old the avocado slices were. The guy was conversing with the girl, blaming it on the morning/afternoon employee and said if the avocados were still there in the morning then toss them. How health code and sanitary savvy. We didn't eat the sandwich with avocados. Went to the trash. The guy also made a comment to the girl about the things he had left to do in the back and said something about getting some me or happy time with a hand gesture.  I don't think I need to elaborate any further on that because it was pretty easy to infer what was going on. \n\n\nMessage to the owner; I don't care what your employees are doing on the clock if it does not pose a health risk to me, but you should care deeply how they represent your establishment and company good will. \n\nHere is the receipt info so that in the event you do not know what is going on in your establishment and would like to keep your clientele you can address these two fine model employees:\n\nPort of subs 92\n2642 horizon\n702 914 8288\nTicket #136 IN\nAmmount $15.06 \nPayment: charge\n6455 20:25 #01 AUG.30'14 REG0001","user_id":88}

They slice the meat and cheese right in front of you, bake the bread in house, and they keep their veggies fresh and crisp. They offer what are more or less the standard options for meat, cheese, bread, and toppings, so what separates them from the competition is the quality. The meats are all fantastic, resembling the cold cuts you would get at a legitimate deli rather than those from a fast food sandwich shop (like Subway for example). This is about the only corporate sandwich place that I trust enough to actually order the tuna salad. The cheeses are also quite good, and they offer smoked cheddar as an option, which is sheer genius. Bread options are a bit limited compared to some places, but it's always been soft and delicious, with just enough tooth to it to be satisfying. The exception to this is the sourdough, which I find to be a bit too dense and chewy a bread for a sub like this. The toppings choices also offer nothing unexpected, but they are generally fresh and tasty. Usually, they give you a pretty good helping of the meat and cheese, but they are often a bit stingy on the veggies. You can hound them for more, this gets annoying for everyone involved. Still, given the price, it's one of the best options out there for a good sub.","user_id":42}

There are however, two things that speak volumes about this Port of Subs. The first is that while most of the rest of the shopping center they are in is dead and gone this store still survives and in fact, is usually pretty busy. The other thing is that the same folks have worked there forever. Generally these types of businesses have a big employee turnover rate. Not here! The bulk of the workers have been there for quite a while. I guess that speaks well of the owners.

Never really thought to stop in because I thought it would be the same ol' sub chain type place you're used to like Subway, etc and I'm not really a fan of the chain sandwich places.  However, I came to find out that this is Subway kicked up a notch!\n\nFirst, I was VERY pleased to see the sticker in the window that they have a new tuna melt griller sandwich.  YUM.  That's exactly what I wanted, and it's exactly what I got.  It was quite tasty.  I'm not sure what the cheese was, but it was delish.  Plenty of tuna and put on all the fixins I wanted (like jalapenos, mmm, my mouth is watering).\n\nI loved that they had a \"medium\" option (small = 5 inches, medium = 8, large = 12).\n\nThe line was HUGE and since this place isn't really convenient to get into (kind of an akward spot right off the freeway) I'm assuming that all their sandwiches are tasty to get that many people lining up for them.\n\nHubby got a cold sandwich (turkey & pastrami I think?) and liked it too.\n\nNow that I know I can get tasty wiches here, I'll be a regular here for sure.\n\nOnly complaint, a \"little\" pricey for a sub (like $6-7 for a medium) but I think it was still worth it.\n\np.s. they have breakfast sandwiches!

I basically cram my thanksgiving dinner into rolls anyways (bread is a great vessel for shoving large amounts of food into ones mouth) so it would be like a little thanksgiving dinner for me. \n\nWalked in at 1 pm on a Thursday. Only one guy sitting there and it was nice and quiet. Ordered my pilgrim on sourdough with provolone, lettuce, *thinly sliced* pickle, tomatoes, olive, peppers and pepper. Took one bite and fell in love. The combo of sagey stuffing with the thin turkey and veggies and the sweet cranberries and tangy (fresh) sourdough bread definitely hit the spot!

It is not great, not bad, just okay. They do freshly slice meats and cheeses which is a step up from the pre-packaged, slimy looking meats that they serve at Subway. On my most recent visit I had a buffalo chicken grilled sandwich with ranch and jalapenos. It was served warm, pressed like a panini. I was hoping that it would have deli sliced chicken and not pre cut chicken pieces but it had the chicken pieces. I have had bad experiences with this type of meat in the past so I was a little worried. To my surprise, it was very tasty. I have also had the Italian #1 sandwich here which is also very good. The bread is not the best I have had but not bad.\n\nI have had pretty good customer service when I have been in. I do feel like the sandwiches here are a little overpriced for what you get. For a small sandwich, chips and a drink it comes to around $9.00. I think that is a little much for the quality of food that you get.

The sub ran $5.79, plus $1.59 for a small drink, with tax the total was $8.07. \n\nI would say my original impression that: \"Port of Sub is really good, not great, but really good\" was generous. \n\nI believe the sub was bland and they didn't have anything interesting, except for banana peppers and shaved lettuce and tomato to put on it. \n\nSo, I'm revising my rating to two stars instead of three. Yelpr'er Kelly B. might be closer to the mark then me and her review is nearly five years old! \n\nSo, in the future I'll pass on Port of Subs!","user_id":27}

So beware about going during rush times 11 AM - 1 PM. I happened upon this place because it is close to the yoga studio I am currently going to.

It makes for quick meal before or after my yoga class.\n\nThe staff is nice and they're quick. I love POS sandwiches and I rarely happen upon a poorly made sandwich.

(It's a combo spread and it's pretty delish). Smoked ham, turkey, and smokey cheddar cheese, yum!\n\nThis sub restaurant sets itself apart from other sub chains by offering a bigger selection of good breads (including the aforementioned sourdough bread mmmmmMMMMmmmm) and cheeses, and freshly slicing its meats and cheeses. I, uh, have never worked in a deli, or really in any food service type of industry, so I don't know if this actually makes the meat and cheese better...though it does mean it isn't sliced days/weeks/months earlier, right? Must be at least a bit fresher. It is tastier than I remember Subway or Quizno's being.\n\nThe service is a touch slower, because of the fresh slicing, but still very friendly. \nI think the biggest problem at this Port of Subs might be the parking lot. Doesn't seem like it would ever be filled (it's huge), but the people driving are, well, sort of terrifying, and there's people walking around a lot. So just be careful, please!\n\nI would definitely recommend this sub restaurant for a quick meal on the go!","user_id":50}

I have never been to a Port of Subs before.\n\nI got a small (5 inch) sandwich that was their limited time/special sandwich-bacon, turkey,provolone and avocado. They have the usual toppings that you can elect to have: lettuce, tomato, red onion. olives, etc. They also have the oil&vinegar, mayo, mustard, salt and pepper and they have dried oregano too. \n\nI got it as a meal with drink and chips and it was $8 and some change. \n\nThe sandwich had fresh sliced meats, but it's not like it made a significant difference from any other deli sliced sandwich shops. The veggie toppings weren't as fresh. There was no lid on the mayo or mustard and salads (mac, potato and tuna salad) which makes it build a \"crust\" where it oxidized. Overall sandwich was just okay.\n\nFor the price, and especially since Subway is across the street- I don't know how they make business. I was the only one there during prime lunch time with one to-go order. At least at subway I can get a $5 footlong of a sliced turkey sandwich and have half left for later.

My name is Skacey, I carry a short amount of time to get fed and get back to work.\n\n11:43 AM, I step into the Port of Subs on West Badura. There are two dames behind the counter, to protect their identities, I'll call them Laverne and Shirley. There is one other patron in the establishment, quietly sitting and eating at a table by the window. As I step up to the counter, Laverne begins to head to the back and calls out to Shirley:\n\n\"Hey, after this next order, can you clean the slicer\" is what I heard her say, but aparently, Shirley translated that comment to be \"I'm heading in back to slack off, you stay up here and work until your fingers bleed\"\n\nAt this point, I placed my order for a number one (always a safe bet at any fast food joint) As Shirley begins my order, I notice that she is heaping on piles of attitude. Now I'm not allergic to attitude, but I don't think its healthy to eat too much (I hear it gives you wrinkles) - In the interest of getting my order quickly, I let this go.\n\nOnce she is finished with the lunch meat and attitude, she moves to the veggies. In a monotone voice she rattles off the choices and I make my selection. As she begins piling on the foliage, she drizzles dispair and loathing on my sandwich. Now these are just plain unhealthy, but again, I'm pressed for time.\n\nShe finishes my meal and begins wrapping it up, she drops it next to the cash station and calls out to the back a word dripping with disapproval, snarkyness and vitriol. This single word impales itself on the back wall and runs down into a greasy puddle of hate. She said \"Register!\" clearly indicating that her toil was done and that someone else would have to deal with me as a pathetic customer.\n\nLaverne does not show up again to help me, she is likely a quivering mess in the back, dealing with her own issues. The third lady (Joanie?) takes my money and sends me on my way. As I leave, the other patron and I share a glance which reveals our understanding of what just happened.\n\nIf you LOVE smashed bread, mediocre cold cuts, and average veggies, then perhaps it is worth seeing the drama that unfolds as young workers learn skills that will help them eventually raise the unemployment rate. Otherwise, you're better off driving 5 more minutes to another cheap belly filler.","user_id":64}

Meats and cheeses were each cut fresh on the deli slicer. I had a choice of breads and chose sourdough which I thought was pretty good. This place seems to have your standard sub options for toppings but I'm boring so I never take full notice of the toppings because I never take full advantage of them. I noticed the guy in front of me, who I think was also an employee, getting a wrap so I guess it's a good sign that an employee is willing to pay and eat the food there. Service was friendly and I was in and out quickly.\n\nMy particular sandwich was $8 for a 12 inch. Not too bad. It's been a while since I've been to Blimpie but I'm thinking it's around the same price point and a little cheaper than a Jersey Mikes, all of which got their start in New Jersey (take that Jersey haters!). To me it's worth it to drop the extra $3 and have a sandwich that tastes like a sandwich and not something that's been peed on in the Subway.\n\nSo far so good and I hope they do well.\n\nOther info:\n\nWhen talking to the manager I was told that this particular store is corporate owned and not franchised.\n\nWhile I've never had a problem stopping for a sandwich at this place in the evening (as either a quizno's or port of subs) it can get kinda hectic around lunch as the parking lot is pretty darn tiny.","user_id":79}

He put one scoop that was about the size of a quarter on the sandwich. He attempted a second scoop, which he had to scrape around the bucket, and then fumbled the exchange as he tried to put it on the sandwich. As both dabs of avocado hit the table, he reached for the spatula. The spatula was not much better as he dropped it, and attempted to schmear the little avocado on the bread.

I call it the Italian meat buffet because it is loaded with pepperoni, salami, capicolla, ham, and provolone on bread and it is fantastic.  I am drooling just thinking about it!

The veggies, even though I don't eat them, all look fresh and much nicer than the veggies at Subway.  The bread is always flaky and fresh and tastes great.  They always have a huge selection of sides as well.  I am just happy with my jalapeño chips though and really haven't tried the other items.

I was expecting a low-end Subway (which I don't really enjoy in the first place), so imagine my delight when I found out that they have warm sandwiches in addition to subs, and in addition to warm sandwiches, they have wraps [insert pun joke here]! I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork wrap, and was excited to find that one of the things that they do have in common with Subway is the \"choose your own toppings\" option. I'm pretty simple when it comes to my sandwiches, so this is an appealing feature for me. I ordered it with onions and pepperjack cheese, and after they'd tossed it on the grill I paid up and sat down to enjoy. And oh, did I enjoy! That wrap didn't stand a chance...after the first bite I was sold. I would have downed it much more quickly than I did if I hadn't been with a coworker that I didn't know super well...no use giving her the impression that I'm a total pig. \n\nI wouldn't say it was dirt cheap, but $9.36 for a wrap, a bag of chips and a soda isn't overly expensive, either, and it was WELL worth it. I highly recommend this place, a) because they give you options and b) because their food is yummy...or at least the pulled pork is! \n\nI see from Russell S.'s review that this place is, in fact, a chain, but since I am not a Phoenix native and therefore have been left to form an opinion of this place all on my own without any pre-disposed bias (no offense, Russell...it happens to the best of us), I'm inclined to give this place 2 thumbs up (read: 4 stars)...hopefully, I'll be back!","user_id":53}

I chose to have it on sourdough with all the fixins. I also had the bread grilled which made it taste even more awesome!\n\nThe fact that they slice the meat makes it taste really fresh. When you go to Subway, their meat is already sliced and their chicken breast is a processed by product. Once you have a Port of Subs sandwich, Subway will seem to taste just a little bit more bland. To me Port of Subs tastes so much fresher. \n\nSizes: Small 5\", Medium 8\", Large 12\" or X-Large 2', served on a white, wheat or sourdough roll. All sandwiches served with lettuce, tomatoes, purple onions, oil, vinegar and spices unless otherwise requested. Pickles, peppers & black olives available upon request. Cheese selection: Provolone, Swiss, Smokey Cheddar & American.\n\nOverall service, cleanliness (especially the bathroom), and friendliness all receive high marks.

However, this store became the exception to my rule this week. I went at lunch time so it was understandably busy but I wasn't greeted or acknowledged until I was served. I order the vegetarian sandwich. This is where my visit went downhill. This particular location only has one meat/cheese cutter--which means that the meat AND the cheese are sliced on the same machine--which means that even their \"vegetarian sandwich\" is going to have meat goo on it. BUMMER. This is a deal breaker for me but because I had already waited so long to be served I didn't have time to go anywhere else to get food. As I was checking out, I was charged for the avocado I asked for on my sandwich even though it states on the menu that it is included. The less-than-helpful cashier argued with me about it and at the end, I still ended up getting charged. Absolutely, positively will not be returning to this location.","user_id":76}

So I walk in at about 7pm on a Sunday; the lights were on, \"open\" sign blazing, and the guy behind the counter asked me \"What can I get for you?\"  So, the idiot that I am, I assumed they were open for business.\n\nEvidently not.  I wasn't eyeballing the counter too hard so I didn't notice that they had put the bread and such away until he very laboriously dragged it back out.  He sighed and scowled at me the entire time, and was sarcastic and rude whenever he spoke.  He made it extremely clear that he wanted me out of his shop and wished that I hadn't come in.  It was also made clear to me that they had to re-open the register for my order.\n\nI've worked in a shop before, and I really did feel guilty.  I know what it's like to have people come in just before closing, but I've never treated a customer that badly just for some last minute business.  But the kicker is that it was 2 hours before posted closing time, and they hadn't bothered to turn off the sign OR lock the door, even though they had apparently shut down the register.  I'm not a mind reader; I don't know you're closing 2 hours early unless I'm told.  He could have easily said \"sorry, we've just closed\" and I would have said \"oh sorry dude\" and walked out, no problem.  Though I was getting sandwiches for my parents, I'm sure they could have lived with something else.  With the same ingredients, I can make better ones at home.  I'm glad I wasn't getting anything for myself, because after the way this man treated me I doubt I would have wanted to eat it.\n\nI don't know why they happened to be closing early, and I don't care.  I just wish the older gent that \"served\" me had been honest and said they'd closed instead of using his precious five minutes to treat me like a rat turd in his lentil soup.\n\nNeedless to say, I've been put off and I doubt I'll go back.","user_id":32}

One, I do not understand paying the exact same for a sandwich because their options vary in meat selection and non-meat selections. A turkey and provolone should not cost the same as a meat stuffed with 4-5 different meats. Just sayin. And two, which is my biggest criticism, is they are ONLY OPEN UNTIL 5PM?!?!?! What kind of crap is that?!?! How much business is this place losing by closing so early? I came here for dinner once and was shooed away at the door at 4:59PM. Wow.\n\nAll in all, this place is good and would recommend. Their meat and cheeses are sliced fresh every order and I do like the fact there are 2 separate counters for ordering. Prices are also reasonable, way better than Jersey Mike's. Location here isn't awesome, it's a little hidden off Broadway and 48th street. It's next to Papa John's so when you see that, turn into the complex with Staples.  It's minutes from work so I am somewhat of a regular here. Will keep coming back because it's yummy!","user_id":52}

The downside was the limited choice of condiments. Nothing lite or low calorie other than plain yellow mustard. I went with the mustard. Ended up with way too much, and it was very strong. The other thing is there was just way too much bread. I took the top bun off and solved both problems.\n\nWe got there at the tail end of lunch. There was a small line, but it moved quickly.

I have been to other Port of Subs and they usually dont disappoint. Well this one really disappointed.\n\nMe and my 12 year old son ordered an Extra Large #1 which was a 2 footer on sourdough and the wifey ordered a Medium Avocado Turkey and Bacon which was 8 inches on sourdough as well.\n\nThe #1 has Capicola, Salami, Ham, and Pepperoni with Provolone Cheese. The Avocado Turkey Bacon was exactly that. We had them put everything on both sandwiches like lettuce, onions, mustard, mayo, etc. \n\nThe major disappointment was that the bread for both orders were dry, which was too bad because it kind of cancelled out the good taste of what was inside the sandwiches. I was only able to eat half my sandwich since I didnt really find it too appealing.\n\nService was nice and friendly. I was glad that they were open while everybody else decided to stay closed.\n\nIn closing, I have had a sandwich here before but the bread was never that dry.

Well, that may not be true--when I called to try and place an order for delivery, she asked if it was a catering order. Unlike the South Rainbow location, which the Port of Subs website says offers delivery but in fact does not, this location is listed on the website as offering delivery with a $50 minimum order. Which makes it sound more akin to just catering orders, but given the fact that a lot of other reviewers have indicated skimpy portioning practices and scarcity of included napkins, one can draw some conclusions about the location and its service as a whole.\nThe lady seemed friendly enough for somebody who wasn't actually really apologetic about the fact their location won't deliver unless (possibly) you pony up some serious dough for sandwich fixins, but after I called the location down south on Badura and had not only a great sandwich delivered to my location (which no other Port of Subs in the area would do) but a very pleasant time talking to the attendant who double-checked my order and ensured I knew about any prospective delays, menu options or pricings, I won't likely stop by this location because let's face it--there's a better one that brings the sandwich *to me*.","user_id":37}

Today I got a grilled breakfast sandwich. My first time ordering this, and I decided on the turkey sausage, egg and cheese griller. My impression was that the sandwich was like a panini, as it looked in the pictures (they did use a panini press, but they use the same bread they do for the subs, so it didn't get the nice little crunch you get with a panini). I chose smoked cheddar for the cheese, and then asked if they could put some tomato on the sandwich as well. The young lady said she would get the toppings I wanted in a moment, at which time she grilled the sandwich. After she grilled it, she brought it over and asked what I wanted to add to it. I asked for tomato and pepper. She split the sandwich back open and added what I asked for. I would've preferred the tomatoes to be warm like the rest of the ingredients, but they made the sandwich lukewarm when I started eating it. The sandwich was pretty tasty, I should've had a little hot sauce or something though to add a little zing to it. If you've never had it, give it a try. I ordered a Medium, which was 8\", and it was five bucks. Not a bad deal at all.","user_id":51}

It's like Subway's more polished older brother.  The bread is much better, the meat tastes fresher, and I think you get more food (although maybe it costs more - it's been a while since I've been to Subway now!)\n\nThis particular Port of Subs has nice staff and a great atmosphere. When I order from them online they do a great job putting the order together.  Just like Subway, you tell them what you want and they make the sandwich in front of you. They slice the meat fresh, which makes a difference,  If you order the sandwich grilled, they stick it in a little panini-like grill thingie, (which really doesn't do much more than put lines on the bread).  They only offer like 3 kinds of bread, but since Subway seems to always be out of the breads I want, Port of Subs is probably smart to stick to a few choices. Stick to a few things and do it well, I say.  I'm a fan!","user_id":30}

Then there are two middle aged employees that usually work during the day that are very sloppy when making a sandwich. They're friendly enough but that doesn't make my sandwich taste good. I prefer to go when the two young guys are working but it doesn't always work that way.

Second, there was no croutons, no parmesan, and the lettuce was a shredded iceberg/romaine mix. To top it all the dressing wasn't a creamy caesar dressing so I was 100% disappointed with this salad.

OMG this place rocks!  Everything here is fresh on site.  The bread is cooked and fresh, and they have white, wheat and Sourdough.  They have 3 sized subs, and a menu a mile long.  They have 18 cold subs to choose from, and some hot subs to choose as well.\n\nThey cut the meat as you order your sandwich. Not predone like other lame chains that shall go unnamed.\n\nI usually get a #18, which is Roast Beef and Turkey with cheese.  mmmm, tasty.  I usually order a really big sub, eat half there, and take the other half home to eat for later.  I like it here because I really feel like I get a lot of food for my money.\n\nThere are two reasons why I gave them 4 stars.  First, this location has really crappy hours.  They close early, and sometimes, I can't get to them before they close.  I think they close at like 6PM or something.  booo!  Who are you catering to with this schedule?  I think they should be open until at least 8 PM.  so, points lost for crappy hours.\n\nThe other thing I am docking them for, was I had a bad service experience there today.  There were 3 people working behind the counter that I could see.  One girl slicing meat, one guy running the register, and a third guy doing stock and stuff with bread in the oven.\n\nWell, since I got the combo meal which includes a beverage and chips, I went to the chip area and it looked pretty hit and wiped out.  The only chips left were the crappy flavors that I do not like.  I want plain chips, thats all.  I didnt want jalapeno (stomach doesnt like it) nor did I want the Dill flavored either.  I asked the gentleman who was doing bread and stock if he had any plain chips available.  He was rather snappy with me and said \"if we had them, they would be out there.  Whatever we have is on the shelf.\"  He quickly blew me off, and I was aggrivated.  He told me to look at the other chip stand to see if I could find what I was looking for. \n\nFortunately, I got my plain chips, but nothing irriates me more then the annoying response of \"If we had it, it would be out there.\"  Bullsh!t! Your just to lazy to go look.  I know you have cases of chips in the back, so stop stocking your cups and get me some chips.\n\nAside from the snotty stocker guy, the other two people working there were wonderful.   The register guy wrapped one half of my sandwich for me to go, and served the other one for me to stay and eat in the resturant.","user_id":11}
