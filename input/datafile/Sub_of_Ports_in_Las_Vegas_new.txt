I have never been to a Port of Subs before.\n\nI got a small (5 inch) sandwich that was their limited time/special sandwich-bacon, turkey,provolone and avocado. They have the usual toppings that you can elect to have: lettuce, tomato, red onion. olives, etc. They also have the oil&vinegar, mayo, mustard, salt and pepper and they have dried oregano too. \n\nI got it as a meal with drink and chips and it was $8 and some change. \n\nThe sandwich had fresh sliced meats, but it's not like it made a significant difference from any other deli sliced sandwich shops. The veggie toppings weren't as fresh. There was no lid on the mayo or mustard and salads (mac, potato and tuna salad) which makes it build a \"crust\" where it oxidized. Overall sandwich was just okay.\n\nFor the price, and especially since Subway is across the street- I don't know how they make business. I was the only one there during prime lunch time with one to-go order. At least at subway I can get a $5 footlong of a sliced turkey sandwich and have half left for later.

I didn't eat here much before I was a vegetarian, but have been rocking the veggie subs here since that time. \nThis location is one of the 2 locations nearest my home. This location is typically clean, but occasionally there are some sketch characters hanging around this location.

She is super friendly and does not skip on the veggies. When I order a veggie sandwich, I would assume sandwich shops wouldn't skimp on the veggies, well some do, but not this one. My favorite part of any POS sandwich is the cheese. They have really good cheese. My fave is the smoky cheddar (as previously mentioned, but it  really does deserve another shout out), a close second is the provolone. The cheese here is no exception. Each and every delicious slice is laid out upon the fresh bread to make a little piece of heaven that will soon be enjoyed by my taste buds. Ok, now I am hungry. \n\nI only have 2 concerns with this Port of Subs. \n1) They close super early (7pm or 8pm depending on if they've had a dinner rush)\n2) They do not accept the Port of Subs loyalty card.

I am merely one person with my own opinion and you don't have to pay a wit of attention to this! .... \nHaving said that, I blame myself for the lousy, ok, wretched sub I just had.  \n1.I  forgot, 2. was lazy and 3. had forgiven P.O.S. for their past sins.... I forgot that the last time I was at P.O.S. about 2 years ago, I hated their subs, I hated the sloppiness of them and the pitiful condiment/veggie selection.  I was lazy, there is a P.O. S. right by my house, so convenience was paramount today, I had been working around the house all day and when I realized the time, I was too lazy to drive to Subway/Jersey Mikes/Jason's Deli, hell even the gas station would have been better.  And going back to my #1 issue, I forgot how much I disliked P.O.S. that I forgave them, I thought maybe I had got a sub when one of the workers was having a bad day or maybe my tastebuds were having the bad day. So when I went there today all three of those issues came into play for me. \nI gave this review one star because I will say this, the staff was very nice, very pleasant, and that goes a long way with me, I have boycotted other food joints for the service, I mean the food may have been great, but bad service will kill if for me, my money spends everywhere, and trust me, in Vegas, I can find hundreds of places I can eat at. \nSo to end my rant, which is what I feel like I have been doing, I dislike P.O.S., I dislike your sloppy, tasteless, pathetic attempt at being a reputable sub shop.  I will make a concerted effort to remember this, so in 2 years from now I won't find myself at P.O. S. again and kicking myself for not remembering that I could have got a better sub at the Albertson's pre-made sandwich section.","user_id":"Ie_V0A-EofIgKV4HvzOC6Q"}

The veggies, even though I don't eat them, all look fresh and much nicer than the veggies at Subway.  The bread is always flaky and fresh and tastes great.  They always have a huge selection of sides as well.  I am just happy with my jalapeño chips though and really haven't tried the other items.

When I order from them online they do a great job putting the order together.  Just like Subway, you tell them what you want and they make the sandwich in front of you. They slice the meat fresh, which makes a difference,  If you order the sandwich grilled, they stick it in a little panini-like grill thingie, (which really doesn't do much more than put lines on the bread).

So I walk in at about 7pm on a Sunday; the lights were on, \"open\" sign blazing, and the guy behind the counter asked me \"What can I get for you?\"  So, the idiot that I am, I assumed they were open for business.\n\nEvidently not.  I wasn't eyeballing the counter too hard so I didn't notice that they had put the bread and such away until he very laboriously dragged it back out.  He sighed and scowled at me the entire time, and was sarcastic and rude whenever he spoke.  He made it extremely clear that he wanted me out of his shop and wished that I hadn't come in.  It was also made clear to me that they had to re-open the register for my order.\n\nI've worked in a shop before, and I really did feel guilty.  I know what it's like to have people come in just before closing, but I've never treated a customer that badly just for some last minute business.  But the kicker is that it was 2 hours before posted closing time, and they hadn't bothered to turn off the sign OR lock the door, even though they had apparently shut down the register.  I'm not a mind reader; I don't know you're closing 2 hours early unless I'm told.  He could have easily said \"sorry, we've just closed\" and I would have said \"oh sorry dude\" and walked out, no problem.  Though I was getting sandwiches for my parents, I'm sure they could have lived with something else.  With the same ingredients, I can make better ones at home.  I'm glad I wasn't getting anything for myself, because after the way this man treated me I doubt I would have wanted to eat it.\n\nI don't know why they happened to be closing early, and I don't care.

The young lady said she would get the toppings I wanted in a moment, at which time she grilled the sandwich. After she grilled it, she brought it over and asked what I wanted to add to it. I asked for tomato and pepper. She split the sandwich back open and added what I asked for. I would've preferred the tomatoes to be warm like the rest of the ingredients, but they made the sandwich lukewarm when I started eating it.

I love 'em. They're so quintessential to American everyday life so I love having a lot of options of sandwich places where I live. \n\nPort of Subs has been a favorite of mine since college. My first big time crush/love worked at Port of Subs for many years so it was always good for me to go out of my way to get my sandwiches at POS.\n\nThis one is okay. As it is the closest to my house it is the one I go to normally. The staff here is really young, gotta be high school students. Not that that's a bad thing, but sometimes when I walk in here I get the vibe that says: \"WHAT are you doing here? WE don't want to actually work!\" Yah. And then you gotta order your sandwich from an angry little teenager and watch them to make sure it gets made how you want it. Which is not a problem because you do get to watch them make it - I love that. Especially since you can just easily ask \"Hey can I get a few more pickles?\" \n\nI like their mayo/mustard combo and the fact that they slice the meat right there before putting it on your sandwich. Usually I get a #5 (turkey, ham, smoked cheddar), but yesterday I got the #3 (turkey, salami, cheddar). Typically I don't go for the salami-type meats, but it turned out pretty good! The reason I ended up getting that sandwich was because I said \"I want a number 3, er I meant 5\", but apparently the lady did not hear my correction. Oh well, her mistake kind of made my day, because I got to try a new sandwich and I liked it! However, still kind of bad that she wasn't listening to me enough to hear me correct myself.\n\nOh well, all in all I like POS.

My name is Skacey, I carry a short amount of time to get fed and get back to work.\n\n11:43 AM, I step into the Port of Subs on West Badura. There are two dames behind the counter, to protect their identities, I'll call them Laverne and Shirley. There is one other patron in the establishment, quietly sitting and eating at a table by the window. As I step up to the counter, Laverne begins to head to the back and calls out to Shirley:\n\n\"Hey, after this next order, can you clean the slicer\" is what I heard her say, but aparently, Shirley translated that comment to be \"I'm heading in back to slack off, you stay up here and work until your fingers bleed\"\n\nAt this point, I placed my order for a number one (always a safe bet at any fast food joint) As Shirley begins my order, I notice that she is heaping on piles of attitude. Now I'm not allergic to attitude, but I don't think its healthy to eat too much (I hear it gives you wrinkles) - In the interest of getting my order quickly, I let this go.\n\nOnce she is finished with the lunch meat and attitude, she moves to the veggies. In a monotone voice she rattles off the choices and I make my selection. As she begins piling on the foliage, she drizzles dispair and loathing on my sandwich. Now these are just plain unhealthy, but again, I'm pressed for time.\n\nShe finishes my meal and begins wrapping it up, she drops it next to the cash station and calls out to the back a word dripping with disapproval, snarkyness and vitriol. This single word impales itself on the back wall and runs down into a greasy puddle of hate. She said \"Register!\" clearly indicating that her toil was done and that someone else would have to deal with me as a pathetic customer.\n\nLaverne does not show up again to help me, she is likely a quivering mess in the back, dealing with her own issues. The third lady (Joanie?) takes my money and sends me on my way. As I leave, the other patron and I share a glance which reveals our understanding of what just happened.\n\nIf you LOVE smashed bread, mediocre cold cuts, and average veggies, then perhaps it is worth seeing the drama that unfolds as young workers learn skills that will help them eventually raise the unemployment rate.

I will really try anything.  If you have ever tried Balut, then you know what I am talking about.  I know what your are saying, how is this guy talking about balut with a sandwich review?  \n\nI am saying this because when it comes to port of subs I am not adventurous at all.  In fact I get the same sandwich every time.  I get the #5 Smoked Ham, Turkey & Smokey Cheddar Cheese.  Yeah I know it's crazy, I mean there are 2 smoked items on this thing!  Ok I'm kidding, but I'm not.  I have to say I love this sandwich because it never disappoints me.  \n\nPort of Subs is that sandwich place that you always forget about and then realize you are missing out.  They have slicers set up so you know you are getting fresh cut meat as you order.  I really like their patented mustard mayo combination. (I think it's patented.)  This is such a mind blowing idea to mix the to condiments together!  The veggies always look fresh.  Overall they are tasty sandwiches.  \n\nIf you are in the area check this place out.  It is a little tucked away in this strip mall.  Watch out when you are driving it this place because I have dubbed it the parking lot of doom.  When you go you will know what I am talking about.

The store is clean and usually very well kept.  \n\nI am boring and always get the #1. I call it the Italian meat buffet because it is loaded with pepperoni, salami, capicolla, ham, and provolone on bread and it is fantastic.  I am drooling just thinking about it!  I am kind of anti-veggie, so I go with just the meat, cheese, pickles, extra mustard/mayo spread, and all of the seasonings.  It is tasty!\n\nMy hubby always get the #2, which is the turkey, ham, and cheese.  He loves it and is always a happy camper afterwards.  I guess we just know what we like!\n\nI like how everything is sliced fresh for your order.  The veggies, even though I don't eat them, all look fresh and much nicer than the veggies at that other chain sub shop.  The bread is always flaky and fresh and tastes great.  They always have a huge selection of sides as well with about 10 chip types, cookies, and brownies.  I am just happy with my jalapeño chips though and really haven't tried the other items.  My hubby likes their cookies and brownies though and he gets at least 1 every time we are there.\n\nOverall if you want a sandwich quick, this is a great location to grab one and go.","user_id":"Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w"}
