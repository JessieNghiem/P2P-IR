The Avocado Turkey Bacon was exactly that. We had them put everything on both sandwiches like lettuce, onions, mustard, mayo, etc. \n\nThe major disappointment was that the bread for both orders were dry, which was too bad because it kind of cancelled out the good taste of what was inside the sandwiches.

They have the usual toppings that you can elect to have: lettuce, tomato, red onion. olives, etc. They also have the oil&vinegar, mayo, mustard, salt and pepper and they have dried oregano too. \n\nI got it as a meal with drink and chips and it was $8 and some change. \n\nThe sandwich had fresh sliced meats, but it's not like it made a significant difference from any other deli sliced sandwich shops. The veggie toppings weren't as fresh. There was no lid on the mayo or mustard and salads (mac, potato and tuna salad) which makes it build a \"crust\" where it oxidized. Overall sandwich was just okay.\n\nFor the price, and especially since Subway is across the street- I don't know how they make business. I was the only one there during prime lunch time with one to-go order. At least at subway I can get a $5 footlong of a sliced turkey sandwich and have half left for later. Same taste but more sauce ,bread, and topping selections there for a better price. Guess where I'm going for my next work lunch sandwich?","user_id":7}

I went with the medium (8\") No. 5, which contained Smoked Ham, Turkey, and Smokey Cheddar Cheese. The cheese especially was sliced VERY thin, I could barely even taste it! I wish the lady who was working could have put more layers of meat in my sandwich as well, to make up for those thin slices. \n\nMaybe I just happened to come in on a bad day, but there is nothing special about this place. The sandwich tasted okay and got me full, but I can't think of any reason why I would want to come back. I am actually a fan of Jersey Mike's Subs. Same concept - they slice their meats and cheeses fresh. I have not visited a Jersey Mike's here in Vegas yet, but the locations I used to frequent when I lived in California were awesome! They would really load up your sandwich with all the ingredients, it always tasted good, and the employees were friendly! \n\nI should have spent my $6 across the street at Panda Express or even Krispy Kreme!

I fell in love after tasting their smoky cheddar. The cheese is so creamy, a bit sharp and full of flavor. I didn't eat here much before I was a vegetarian, but have been rocking the veggie subs here since that time. \nThis location is one of the 2 locations nearest my home. This location is typically clean, but occasionally there are some sketch characters hanging around this location. Maybe its because there is a Wal-Mart next store...and I've seen my fair share of  the People of Wal-Mart website to know they usually have sketch characters shopping there :-P. \nBack to the unfortunately acronym-ed POS...I really enjoy the woman who seems to always be working here (maybe she is the owner??). She is super friendly and does not skip on the veggies. When I order a veggie sandwich, I would assume sandwich shops wouldn't skimp on the veggies, well some do, but not this one. My favorite part of any POS sandwich is the cheese. They have really good cheese. My fave is the smoky cheddar (as previously mentioned, but it  really does deserve another shout out), a close second is the provolone. The cheese here is no exception. Each and every delicious slice is laid out upon the fresh bread to make a little piece of heaven that will soon be enjoyed by my taste buds. Ok, now I am hungry. \n\nI only have 2 concerns with this Port of Subs. \n1) They close super early (7pm or 8pm depending on if they've had a dinner rush)\n2) They do not accept the Port of Subs loyalty card. Ugh! That is no fun at all.","user_id":7}

Kinda makes you feel like you're at a local deli shop. I asked what was good and they recommended number one on their numbered menu. This was ham, salami, capicola, and pepperoni. I chose to have it on sourdough with all the fixins. I also had the bread grilled which made it taste even more awesome!\n\nThe fact that they slice the meat makes it taste really fresh. When you go to Subway, their meat is already sliced and their chicken breast is a processed by product. Once you have a Port of Subs sandwich, Subway will seem to taste just a little bit more bland. To me Port of Subs tastes so much fresher. \n\nSizes: Small 5\", Medium 8\", Large 12\" or X-Large 2', served on a white, wheat or sourdough roll. All sandwiches served with lettuce, tomatoes, purple onions, oil, vinegar and spices unless otherwise requested. Pickles, peppers & black olives available upon request. Cheese selection: Provolone, Swiss, Smokey Cheddar & American.\n\nOverall service, cleanliness (especially the bathroom), and friendliness all receive high marks.

However, after frequenting this location for years, I have to write about this shop.  As far as a Port of Subs go, this is the best!   Port of Subs food has a great fresh taste that will blow any Subway away.  However, this particular location tastes even better than any other Port of Subs I've been to!   I order my usual #18 Roast Beef, Turkey and Provolone on wheat and am never disappointed in the years I have been coming here.  I think that what really makes this location stand out from others is the service which is impeccable!  The owner Damon I swear is always here working each time I come in.  I am pretty sure he lives at the shop or at the very least never takes a day off.  I always find him behind the counter making sandwiches and chatting it up with patrons.  Always, always has a smile on his face and may be the nicest guy in the business.  I have to attribute the quality of this location that includes the taste of the food, the always clean dining area and the suburb level of service I get to this guy's managerial style and hustle.

Everyone I've encountered who works here is in a pleasant mood and works very quickly.\n\nThe best part about Port-of-Subs: unlike subway, their bread doesn't get stale while you're eating it. And you can get your sandwich grilled in a panini press, which I think is way better than toasting.","user_id":10}

OMG this place rocks!  Everything here is fresh on site.  The bread is cooked and fresh, and they have white, wheat and Sourdough.  They have 3 sized subs, and a menu a mile long.  They have 18 cold subs to choose from, and some hot subs to choose as well.\n\nThey cut the meat as you order your sandwich. Not predone like other lame chains that shall go unnamed.\n\nI usually get a #18, which is Roast Beef and Turkey with cheese.  mmmm, tasty.  I usually order a really big sub, eat half there, and take the other half home to eat for later.  I like it here because I really feel like I get a lot of food for my money.\n\nThere are two reasons why I gave them 4 stars.  First, this location has really crappy hours.  They close early, and sometimes, I can't get to them before they close.  I think they close at like 6PM or something.  booo!  Who are you catering to with this schedule?  I think they should be open until at least 8 PM.  so, points lost for crappy hours.\n\nThe other thing I am docking them for, was I had a bad service experience there today.  There were 3 people working behind the counter that I could see.  One girl slicing meat, one guy running the register, and a third guy doing stock and stuff with bread in the oven.\n\nWell, since I got the combo meal which includes a beverage and chips, I went to the chip area and it looked pretty hit and wiped out.  The only chips left were the crappy flavors that I do not like.  I want plain chips, thats all.  I didnt want jalapeno (stomach doesnt like it) nor did I want the Dill flavored either.  I asked the gentleman who was doing bread and stock if he had any plain chips available.  He was rather snappy with me and said \"if we had them, they would be out there.  Whatever we have is on the shelf.\"  He quickly blew me off, and I was aggrivated.  He told me to look at the other chip stand to see if I could find what I was looking for. \n\nFortunately, I got my plain chips, but nothing irriates me more then the annoying response of \"If we had it, it would be out there.\"  Bullsh!t! Your just to lazy to go look.  I know you have cases of chips in the back, so stop stocking your cups and get me some chips.\n\nAside from the snotty stocker guy, the other two people working there were wonderful.   The register guy wrapped one half of my sandwich for me to go, and served the other one for me to stay and eat in the resturant.","user_id":11}

It is not great, not bad, just okay. They do freshly slice meats and cheeses which is a step up from the pre-packaged, slimy looking meats that they serve at Subway. On my most recent visit I had a buffalo chicken grilled sandwich with ranch and jalapenos. It was served warm, pressed like a panini. I was hoping that it would have deli sliced chicken and not pre cut chicken pieces but it had the chicken pieces. I have had bad experiences with this type of meat in the past so I was a little worried. To my surprise, it was very tasty. I have also had the Italian #1 sandwich here which is also very good. The bread is not the best I have had but not bad.\n\nI have had pretty good customer service when I have been in. I do feel like the sandwiches here are a little overpriced for what you get. For a small sandwich, chips and a drink it comes to around $9.00. I think that is a little much for the quality of food that you get. Overall Port of Subs is an okay choice if you are wanting a sandwich in this area. There are a few other good options in this area as well. Not sure whether I will be back or not.","user_id":13}

The food is fresh and consistent and they slice the meat to order.\n\nThis location has a great staff. They are busy at lunch because of the offices around the neighborhood. You can expect to wait from noon till about 1:30, however the line moves quick. I appreciate that they have everyone manning a station and everyone knows their responsibilities so there isn't a delay. \n\nMy favorite is #8 - Turkey and Provolone or #18 - Turkey, Roast Beef and Provolone. \n\nYou can order online also.

I came in today to get a sandwich which seriously had barely any meat on it. Compared to the price I was not pleased at all. I bought a large #18 to share with my friend and the sandwich was all lettuce. I'm not normally one to complain because I am a hairdresser and I understand the struggle of having customers that you cannot please no matter what you do. But this was seriously displeasing. I will keep my business at the village square port of subs in summerlin. Where they don't jip you on meat just because they're too busy talking to their coworker.","user_id":18}

The downside was the limited choice of condiments. Nothing lite or low calorie other than plain yellow mustard. I went with the mustard. Ended up with way too much, and it was very strong. The other thing is there was just way too much bread. I took the top bun off and solved both problems.\n\nWe got there at the tail end of lunch. There was a small line, but it moved quickly.

Second, there was no croutons, no parmesan, and the lettuce was a shredded iceberg/romaine mix. To top it all the dressing wasn't a creamy caesar dressing so I was 100% disappointed with this salad.

Depending on what you're shopping for, be it quality, speed, selection, quantity, price, or convenience....why would you go here?\n\nQuality - The subs are better at Albertsons, located in the same building.\nSpeed - When I went there was a single person working on subs, about 5-6 people in line.  The line moved, but again, if speed is a concern, why go here?  The subs are premade next door.\nSelection - Average for a sub place, freshness was great.  But again, more selection next door and it's just as fresh.\nQuantity - Here's where they really fall behind.  At their prices, I'd certainly hope that they do more than just a thin layer of ingrendients, but alas, it was a pretty sparse quantity of meat and cheese.\nConvience - This place is just as convenient location-wise, but has less parking than Albertsons.\nPrice - Spendy.  Out the door you're looking at about $10 for an 8 inch sub combo.\n\nI guess my experience itself wasn't bad...I'll just never be back because I can't justify it in ANY category I can come up with.  Why would you even open up this shop here when you can't compete on any level with the other businesses around?  Within a mile you'll find Subway, Jersey Mike's Quiznos and I'm sure others.  But you don't have to look any further than the grocery store they share a wall with to see them get beat handily.","user_id":28}

I am merely one person with my own opinion and you don't have to pay a wit of attention to this! .... \nHaving said that, I blame myself for the lousy, ok, wretched sub I just had.  \n1.I  forgot, 2. was lazy and 3. had forgiven P.O.S. for their past sins.... I forgot that the last time I was at P.O.S. about 2 years ago, I hated their subs, I hated the sloppiness of them and the pitiful condiment/veggie selection.  I was lazy, there is a P.O. S. right by my house, so convenience was paramount today, I had been working around the house all day and when I realized the time, I was too lazy to drive to Subway/Jersey Mikes/Jason's Deli, hell even the gas station would have been better.  And going back to my #1 issue, I forgot how much I disliked P.O.S. that I forgave them, I thought maybe I had got a sub when one of the workers was having a bad day or maybe my tastebuds were having the bad day. So when I went there today all three of those issues came into play for me. \nI gave this review one star because I will say this, the staff was very nice, very pleasant, and that goes a long way with me, I have boycotted other food joints for the service, I mean the food may have been great, but bad service will kill if for me, my money spends everywhere, and trust me, in Vegas, I can find hundreds of places I can eat at. \nSo to end my rant, which is what I feel like I have been doing, I dislike P.O.S., I dislike your sloppy, tasteless, pathetic attempt at being a reputable sub shop.  I will make a concerted effort to remember this, so in 2 years from now I won't find myself at P.O. S. again and kicking myself for not remembering that I could have got a better sub at the Albertson's pre-made sandwich section.","user_id":28}

The staff at this location was extremely nice, the store was spotless, and the service was super fast.  The trifecta of fast food places, right?\n\nI am boring and always get the #1. I call it the Italian meat buffet because it is loaded with pepperoni, salami, capicolla, ham, and provolone on bread and it is fantastic.  I am drooling just thinking about it!  I am kind of anti-veggie, so I go with just the meat, cheese, extra mustard/mayo spread, and all of the seasonings.  It is tasty!\n\nI like how everything is sliced fresh for your order.  The veggies, even though I don't eat them, all look fresh and much nicer than the veggies at Subway.  The bread is always flaky and fresh and tastes great.  They always have a huge selection of sides as well.  I am just happy with my jalapeño chips though and really haven't tried the other items.  My hubby likes their cookies and brownies though and he gets at least 1 every time we are there.\n\nOverall if you want a sandwich quick, this is a great location to grab one and go.","user_id":28}

They heat the chicken in the microwave then put it into the bread with the cheese and press it in the hot grill thing.

I dunno.\n\nGood sandwich, I used to come here a lot and they still put a huge pile of shredded lettuce in the sandwiches when asked. That's ok but if you are not eating in, the lettuce spills out of the sandwich and in your lap/car/keyboard/tv remote/whatever is beneath your mouth.\n\nIt's a busy store, the guys that run it have been there a few years which is a good thing and everyone was looking happy as they dug themselves out of the shredded lettuce and finished their lunches. \n\nGood option for lunch in North Summerlin.","user_id":30}

It's like Subway's more polished older brother.  The bread is much better, the meat tastes fresher, and I think you get more food (although maybe it costs more - it's been a while since I've been to Subway now!)\n\nThis particular Port of Subs has nice staff and a great atmosphere. When I order from them online they do a great job putting the order together.  Just like Subway, you tell them what you want and they make the sandwich in front of you. They slice the meat fresh, which makes a difference,  If you order the sandwich grilled, they stick it in a little panini-like grill thingie, (which really doesn't do much more than put lines on the bread).  They only offer like 3 kinds of bread, but since Subway seems to always be out of the breads I want, Port of Subs is probably smart to stick to a few choices. Stick to a few things and do it well, I say.  I'm a fan!","user_id":30}

So I walk in at about 7pm on a Sunday; the lights were on, \"open\" sign blazing, and the guy behind the counter asked me \"What can I get for you?\"  So, the idiot that I am, I assumed they were open for business.\n\nEvidently not.  I wasn't eyeballing the counter too hard so I didn't notice that they had put the bread and such away until he very laboriously dragged it back out.  He sighed and scowled at me the entire time, and was sarcastic and rude whenever he spoke.  He made it extremely clear that he wanted me out of his shop and wished that I hadn't come in.  It was also made clear to me that they had to re-open the register for my order.\n\nI've worked in a shop before, and I really did feel guilty.  I know what it's like to have people come in just before closing, but I've never treated a customer that badly just for some last minute business.  But the kicker is that it was 2 hours before posted closing time, and they hadn't bothered to turn off the sign OR lock the door, even though they had apparently shut down the register.  I'm not a mind reader; I don't know you're closing 2 hours early unless I'm told.  He could have easily said \"sorry, we've just closed\" and I would have said \"oh sorry dude\" and walked out, no problem.  Though I was getting sandwiches for my parents, I'm sure they could have lived with something else.  With the same ingredients, I can make better ones at home.  I'm glad I wasn't getting anything for myself, because after the way this man treated me I doubt I would have wanted to eat it.\n\nI don't know why they happened to be closing early, and I don't care.  I just wish the older gent that \"served\" me had been honest and said they'd closed instead of using his precious five minutes to treat me like a rat turd in his lentil soup.\n\nNeedless to say, I've been put off and I doubt I'll go back.","user_id":32}

This place has that in spades...but too many spades! No customer should have to wait longer for their food because an employee is having a long, personal conversation with a customer.

What do you expect in an airport for food options?  Under $5 footlong combo value meals?  Yeah, right.  Try buying your food hours before your flight maybe from your local gas station on the way to the airport, and then MAYBE your reviews make more sense.  I mean, seriously, have you never traveled before???\n\nAnyway, Port of Subs.  It's probably the best option available in the terminal, though tastes may vary.  What is nice is that they offer a variety of fresh sandwiches and salads.  And when I say fresh, I mean they slice the meats to order, like Jersey Mike's, not pull them up from a pre-sliced cauldron of questionable sanitation.  Speaking of which, the place was sparkling clean, too.\n\nThe service was fast, the staff was friendly enough (didn't go out of their way, but wasn't rude either).  I liked that there was a Mrs. Fields in the same kiosk, too... yum... cookies.  Overall, this was the best option I found in the airport and the price was about what I expected.  You KNOW they're going to jack these up at the airport... don't look for normal prices here.  Still worth the value.  A very full and filling sub, fresh ingredients, and fast service.  Can't ask for more!","user_id":39}

That is until I tried this place. I was in the area and decided to give the them a try after spotting their sign. When I first walked in I noticed the place was empty (normally a bad sign) but it was a Thursday afternoon so no big. This was my first time eating here so I took a few minutes to see what they had to offer. The sandwiches here come in different sizes from a small 5 inch to a 2 foot extra long, which makes it easy to decide what to order depending how hungry you are.\n\nThe 8 inch sub is easily enough for one really hungry person or two not so hungry people. Seriously it is about the size of a subway foot long and taste way better to! You have three choices when it comes to bread. They are white, wheat, and sourdough. I chose sourdough for my sandwich and it was chewy and seemed to be really fresh. Like most sub shops they also have a selection of pre selected combos (18 to be exact) with toppings like Ham, Turkey, Pastrami, Salami, Capicolla, Roast Beef, and Tuna. The cheese selection includes Provolone, Swiss, Smokey Cheddar & American\n\nWhat makes this place so different from most sandwich joints is the fact that they hand slice your meat when you order it. No more slimy meat that has been sitting in a case for hours and floating in weird juices Yuck! Finally a place that understands that it is OK to take the time to slice meat for each customer because it makes for a better tasting sandwich. One that a customer will want to come back for over and over again\n\nFor me this place set the bar so high most of the other chain places will never be able to compare with the quality of not only the food but the great customer service that I received from this place. It is not often that a place is able to make such a great impression on me (read my other reviews) but I will definitely make sure to give them my business the next time I am in the mood for a sandwich. The only thing that brought their score down was the fact that they had no customer parking and I had to pay to park in the garage. Yes I understand it is Tempe but why not at least offer to validate my parking LOL.","user_id":39}

I'm originally from Jersey, and I don't know why, but I like ketchup on my cheesesteaks. It was OK though ~ since the rest was so good.\n\nMy buddy liked his pastrami on swiss, commenting that he doesn't like rye bread, so he liked the fact that he could get his pastrami on a plain old white roll.\n\nOh, also, they had one of those new digital Gold Peak iced tea machines and served Coke Zero.

I could eat here and never get sick of the food or the menu items. But, the service here on Sunday left me upset, sad and slightly irritated and annoyed! I've never been to this specific location, but on Sunday I wanted to take some friends on the light rail and then go here for lunch while the weather was still comfortable and nice.\n\nI know this place is near campus, and they probably get a lot of student riff raff, but I was a bit annoyed with the service that I recieved here.  Actually, I'm still bothered almost a day later.  I will attribute it to the fact that its students that were working here behind the counter.\n\nAnyways, for starters, I called here before hand to ask a few location questions.  These girls had NO idea where they were located.  Really, they didn't.  They couldn't tell me not only where they were close to, but had NO idea how far from the light rail they were.  I knew where she was better then she did!  I told her which one of the two stops would be closer for me to deboard at, and she had no clue.  I had to get out my light rail map at home to figure out where they were.  She was totally useless!  I only knew where to go because she told me she was near smashburger...and I figured out where to go from there.\n\nSo friends and I take the light rail down to the College/Veterans Way exit.  We walk to the port of subs and I realize that I have to go to the bathroom.  I was mentioning it to my friends as we walked into the store, and out of no where, some girl at a table boasts out \"WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC BATHROOMS IF YOU NEED TO GO YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AT SUBWAY BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING.\"  Um, I wasn't only NOT talking to her, but the fact that she took it upon herself to YELL it at me as I'm setting foot in the store is a whole different story.  I was SO annoyed!\n\nI mentioned to the service girl who was on break eating a sub that I wasn't addressing her about my bathroom concerns she responded with \"Well, I couldn't help but hear you when you came in.\"  REALLY?!?!?!   STFU please!  Your probably the same girl who answered the phone and doesn't know where your located at!\n\nUgh, the food was good, but the two idiot ding dongs behind the counter need retraining and need to learn to not be beotches!!!","user_id":39}

They slice the meat and cheese right in front of you, bake the bread in house, and they keep their veggies fresh and crisp. They offer what are more or less the standard options for meat, cheese, bread, and toppings, so what separates them from the competition is the quality. The meats are all fantastic, resembling the cold cuts you would get at a legitimate deli rather than those from a fast food sandwich shop (like Subway for example). This is about the only corporate sandwich place that I trust enough to actually order the tuna salad. The cheeses are also quite good, and they offer smoked cheddar as an option, which is sheer genius. Bread options are a bit limited compared to some places, but it's always been soft and delicious, with just enough tooth to it to be satisfying. The exception to this is the sourdough, which I find to be a bit too dense and chewy a bread for a sub like this. The toppings choices also offer nothing unexpected, but they are generally fresh and tasty. Usually, they give you a pretty good helping of the meat and cheese, but they are often a bit stingy on the veggies. You can hound them for more, this gets annoying for everyone involved. Still, given the price, it's one of the best options out there for a good sub.","user_id":42}

I saw a show of teamwork working under pressure without breaking a sweat, not missing a single customers needs and smiling the whole time doing it. Keep up the great work!","user_id":47}

There are however, two things that speak volumes about this Port of Subs. The first is that while most of the rest of the shopping center they are in is dead and gone this store still survives and in fact, is usually pretty busy. The other thing is that the same folks have worked there forever. Generally these types of businesses have a big employee turnover rate. Not here! The bulk of the workers have been there for quite a while. I guess that speaks well of the owners.

(It's a combo spread and it's pretty delish). Smoked ham, turkey, and smokey cheddar cheese, yum!\n\nThis sub restaurant sets itself apart from other sub chains by offering a bigger selection of good breads (including the aforementioned sourdough bread mmmmmMMMMmmmm) and cheeses, and freshly slicing its meats and cheeses. I, uh, have never worked in a deli, or really in any food service type of industry, so I don't know if this actually makes the meat and cheese better...though it does mean it isn't sliced days/weeks/months earlier, right? Must be at least a bit fresher. It is tastier than I remember Subway or Quizno's being.\n\nThe service is a touch slower, because of the fresh slicing, but still very friendly. \nI think the biggest problem at this Port of Subs might be the parking lot. Doesn't seem like it would ever be filled (it's huge), but the people driving are, well, sort of terrifying, and there's people walking around a lot.

Today I got a grilled breakfast sandwich. My first time ordering this, and I decided on the turkey sausage, egg and cheese griller. My impression was that the sandwich was like a panini, as it looked in the pictures (they did use a panini press, but they use the same bread they do for the subs, so it didn't get the nice little crunch you get with a panini). I chose smoked cheddar for the cheese, and then asked if they could put some tomato on the sandwich as well. The young lady said she would get the toppings I wanted in a moment, at which time she grilled the sandwich. After she grilled it, she brought it over and asked what I wanted to add to it. I asked for tomato and pepper. She split the sandwich back open and added what I asked for. I would've preferred the tomatoes to be warm like the rest of the ingredients, but they made the sandwich lukewarm when I started eating it. The sandwich was pretty tasty, I should've had a little hot sauce or something though to add a little zing to it. If you've never had it, give it a try. I ordered a Medium, which was 8\", and it was five bucks. Not a bad deal at all.","user_id":51}

One, I do not understand paying the exact same for a sandwich because their options vary in meat selection and non-meat selections. A turkey and provolone should not cost the same as a meat stuffed with 4-5 different meats. Just sayin. And two, which is my biggest criticism, is they are ONLY OPEN UNTIL 5PM?!?!?! What kind of crap is that?!?! How much business is this place losing by closing so early? I came here for dinner once and was shooed away at the door at 4:59PM. Wow.\n\nAll in all, this place is good and would recommend. Their meat and cheeses are sliced fresh every order and I do like the fact there are 2 separate counters for ordering. Prices are also reasonable, way better than Jersey Mike's. Location here isn't awesome, it's a little hidden off Broadway and 48th street.

I like it here for a few different reasons, and they have a lot going for them.  I noticed a few low reviews, but wanted to chime in and give my two cents as to how much I like it here.\n\nFor starters, they have two lines, which really helps since it seems to be in a busy part of town. There's a lot of business's around and it's close to the airport so I'm sure they get a lot of foot traffic going in and out.  I like that they have two service lines, so there's literally no wait here for getting your food in a short amount of time.  The staff here has been really nice, and seem to get my order out quickly.\n\nThe downside? For starters, the drink station was kinda dirty today, and even though there was a staff member there when I went to refill my drink, she didn't seem to try to clean up the watery mess from someone who must have made a mess between the time I got my first drink and the 15 minutes later when I went to go refill my cup. It appeared that someone splashed a bunch of water all over the counter or ice cubes had been spilled and melted and caused a bit off a pool of water.  It was somewhat disarming since I was in work clothes and didn't want to get stains on my shirt, and I had a book with me and really didn't want to get that wet either.  \n\nThey seem to get a lot of repeat business here since it is in somewhat of a business district. I know they do a punch card system, and I didn't think about it until much later in the day and wish a staff member had said something. I guess they must not be big on enforcing it? Seems like other business's are jamming punch cards down my throat to get me back in the door, but not this port of subs.\n\nOverall a good experience and I'm sure I'll be back in the future.","user_id":52}

I was expecting a low-end Subway (which I don't really enjoy in the first place), so imagine my delight when I found out that they have warm sandwiches in addition to subs, and in addition to warm sandwiches, they have wraps [insert pun joke here]! I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork wrap, and was excited to find that one of the things that they do have in common with Subway is the \"choose your own toppings\" option. I'm pretty simple when it comes to my sandwiches, so this is an appealing feature for me. I ordered it with onions and pepperjack cheese, and after they'd tossed it on the grill I paid up and sat down to enjoy. And oh, did I enjoy! That wrap didn't stand a chance...after the first bite I was sold. I would have downed it much more quickly than I did if I hadn't been with a coworker that I didn't know super well...no use giving her the impression that I'm a total pig. \n\nI wouldn't say it was dirt cheap, but $9.36 for a wrap, a bag of chips and a soda isn't overly expensive, either, and it was WELL worth it. I highly recommend this place, a) because they give you options and b) because their food is yummy...or at least the pulled pork is! \n\nI see from Russell S.'s review that this place is, in fact, a chain, but since I am not a Phoenix native and therefore have been left to form an opinion of this place all on my own without any pre-disposed bias (no offense, Russell...it happens to the best of us), I'm inclined to give this place 2 thumbs up (read: 4 stars)...hopefully, I'll be back!","user_id":53}

The card seems to work at different locations tho.\n\nAs for staying open at night... I don't have any experience with that.  I suspect it has more to do with lack of business than being in a 'bad' neighborhood.  Its a business district close to the airport.

If you're going to build a location in what some people consider (wrongly) a less than desirable location then have the balls to keep it open with the SAME business hours as your other locations.  When you restrict your hours because you are to afraid of your neighborhood you alienate me and I take my business ELSEWHERE.

I love 'em. They're so quintessential to American everyday life so I love having a lot of options of sandwich places where I live. \n\nPort of Subs has been a favorite of mine since college. My first big time crush/love worked at Port of Subs for many years so it was always good for me to go out of my way to get my sandwiches at POS.\n\nThis one is okay. As it is the closest to my house it is the one I go to normally. The staff here is really young, gotta be high school students. Not that that's a bad thing, but sometimes when I walk in here I get the vibe that says: \"WHAT are you doing here? WE don't want to actually work!\" Yah. And then you gotta order your sandwich from an angry little teenager and watch them to make sure it gets made how you want it. Which is not a problem because you do get to watch them make it - I love that. Especially since you can just easily ask \"Hey can I get a few more pickles?\" \n\nI like their mayo/mustard combo and the fact that they slice the meat right there before putting it on your sandwich. Usually I get a #5 (turkey, ham, smoked cheddar), but yesterday I got the #3 (turkey, salami, cheddar). Typically I don't go for the salami-type meats, but it turned out pretty good! The reason I ended up getting that sandwich was because I said \"I want a number 3, er I meant 5\", but apparently the lady did not hear my correction. Oh well, her mistake kind of made my day, because I got to try a new sandwich and I liked it! However, still kind of bad that she wasn't listening to me enough to hear me correct myself.\n\nOh well, all in all I like POS. If you go here often make sure to get their stamp card so you can eventually get a free sandwich!","user_id":54}

After this point I was informed that the sandwich maker had \"never heard that before.\" Alright that's not so bad in itself. But my co-worker ordered a chicken salad... and the chicken was immediately stuck in the microwave; then a couple minutes later, he was asked if he wanted it hot or cold. When he said that he would have preferred cold, they pulled another bucket of chicken out only to realize that they store their chicken frozen.

Considering we have lots and lots of sun here in Phoenix, and even more sub shops than days of sunshine, what's one more sub restaurant?\n\nWell, I have to say that Port of Subs does it best.  They don't waste their time with cute and gimmicky bread flavors.  They only have white, wheat, and sourdough.  And this is real bread, with some texture and flavor, not some lifeless excuse for generic Wonder Bread.  And you can get a 2 foot sub here, which I can have split up for the whole family.  Their staff is so friendly here, that they will cut it into as many slices as you want, which is great for my kids.  The manager at this location is particularly good.  He goes the extra mile to make sure you get your food how you want it, and he makes you feel welcome from the beginning to the end of your experience.\n\nSo you ask, \"big deal, they have a 2 foot sub here - what really makes them different?\"  All meats and cheeses are sliced to order so you know where it comes from and it's not sitting there drying, oxidizing, and degrading all day while sitting out.  This is a huge difference from other places.  The other huge difference is that their bags of chips are bigger, and their standard drink sizes are bigger than any other sandwich place, not to mention the variety of drinks and chips are superior.","user_id":61}

My name is Skacey, I carry a short amount of time to get fed and get back to work.\n\n11:43 AM, I step into the Port of Subs on West Badura. There are two dames behind the counter, to protect their identities, I'll call them Laverne and Shirley. There is one other patron in the establishment, quietly sitting and eating at a table by the window. As I step up to the counter, Laverne begins to head to the back and calls out to Shirley:\n\n\"Hey, after this next order, can you clean the slicer\" is what I heard her say, but aparently, Shirley translated that comment to be \"I'm heading in back to slack off, you stay up here and work until your fingers bleed\"\n\nAt this point, I placed my order for a number one (always a safe bet at any fast food joint) As Shirley begins my order, I notice that she is heaping on piles of attitude. Now I'm not allergic to attitude, but I don't think its healthy to eat too much (I hear it gives you wrinkles) - In the interest of getting my order quickly, I let this go.\n\nOnce she is finished with the lunch meat and attitude, she moves to the veggies. In a monotone voice she rattles off the choices and I make my selection. As she begins piling on the foliage, she drizzles dispair and loathing on my sandwich. Now these are just plain unhealthy, but again, I'm pressed for time.\n\nShe finishes my meal and begins wrapping it up, she drops it next to the cash station and calls out to the back a word dripping with disapproval, snarkyness and vitriol. This single word impales itself on the back wall and runs down into a greasy puddle of hate. She said \"Register!\" clearly indicating that her toil was done and that someone else would have to deal with me as a pathetic customer.\n\nLaverne does not show up again to help me, she is likely a quivering mess in the back, dealing with her own issues. The third lady (Joanie?) takes my money and sends me on my way. As I leave, the other patron and I share a glance which reveals our understanding of what just happened.\n\nIf you LOVE smashed bread, mediocre cold cuts, and average veggies, then perhaps it is worth seeing the drama that unfolds as young workers learn skills that will help them eventually raise the unemployment rate. Otherwise, you're better off driving 5 more minutes to another cheap belly filler.","user_id":64}

Well, that is to say that they don't offer delivery *directly*; they work through a couple of delivery services, apparently, so you can still get your sandwich at home.\nThe problem with third-party services, depending on which ones they are, is that restaurants often have slightly different pricing for delivery orders, it takes longer for processing, pickup and delivery, and there's an extra fee tracked on by the outfit that does it. It's also less convenient.\nI understand that if a location is understaffed, or just can't make having delivery feasible, then it's not really something within their control to provide. The food is still pretty good here, but it seems silly to me to order a sandwich through a delivery service when I could instead order a steak or a plate of pasta from sit-down restaurants that wouldn't feature delivery normally, which is usually why I use delivery services in the first place.","user_id":64}

Their delivery driver was out so my order would be slightly delayed in arrival, she warned me, which is really appreciated--I know that sometimes delays will happen in delivery service, and their honesty about it is a breath of fresh air.\nCan't wait to taste the #18 (Roast Beef, Turkey and Provolone) again.","user_id":65}

There are many options for wraps, even lettuce wraps, salads, and subs or grillers.  There are many options of meat and cheese.  They slice it right in front of you as you order.\n\nSome downsides to this spot - it is a little slow.  I imagine this is because it takes time to slice the meat/cheese.  The person putting the veggies on is never very fast.... the sourdough bread is extremely dry (I suggest another option).  The pasta and macaroni salad is just \"ok\" in my opinion.  I also think that since they are cutting various meat and cheese right there - they SHOULD have a separate meat and cheese slicer.  I find it wrong that it is done all on one...  The prices are average.. I would go more often if it was cheaper, that's for sure.\n\nStill, I have been here MULTIPLE times, and will continue to go here and there.

I looove a veggie sub from Port of Subs. \n\nThey slice the cheese (and meat) here, it's much more appetizing than the cheese/meat you see sitting there at Subway and other sandwich shops. \n\nThe main bonuses here, other than fresh slicing, are the sourdough bread and pepperjack cheese (never know if other sandwich shops have either of those), and first and foremost the mayo/mustard mix. I always get a ton of it. The only reason I took one star off my review is that lately, the mayo/mustard mix tastes a bit different (although that may just be my taste buds??), which was, honestly, the main draw for me, so I find myself coming here less often. \n\nI also really, really appreciate that they clean the machine before slicing the cheese for a veggie (#6) sandwich here. They say it is their policy to do so, but not every location does so...and I have learned to make sure the machine is cleaned first, after I got a sandwich with some slices of meat on it from another location. I appreciate that they do this without my having to ask (esp. since I always feel a little bit bad asking them to take the time to do so, esp. @ lunchtime, when this location gets crazy busy). \n\nAlso love the frequent customer type card, buy 12 get one free!

He attempted a second scoop, which he had to scrape around the bucket, and then fumbled the exchange as he tried to put it on the sandwich.

I highly disagree. Is it a nice touch for a restaurant to cut the meat and cheese fresh, sure I guess. What does this mean for you though? Sometimes less meat/cheese as well as a longer wait in line. I'm not saying I hope the sandwich places I like cut everything a week in advance, I would hope that they just prep in the morning. This sub shop is beyond mediocre. I have eaten here two or three times and it's only because it is so close to work and I didn't have enough time to make it to a better place. Not to rip on these guys but money is money...I like to spend mine where I actually really enjoy the food and it's a treat for me to eat there. I don't get that from here. This is on the same level as Cousins for me...they're both food if you're hungry but they are lower grade sandwiches for the same price as really delicious ones.","user_id":69}

This is such a mind blowing idea to mix the to condiments together!  The veggies always look fresh.  Overall they are tasty sandwiches.  \n\nIf you are in the area check this place out.

I am kind of anti-veggie, so I go with just the meat, cheese, pickles, extra mustard/mayo spread, and all of the seasonings.

The veggies, even though I don't eat them, all look fresh and much nicer than the veggies at that other chain sub shop.  The bread is always flaky and fresh and tastes great.  They always have a huge selection of sides as well with about 10 chip types, cookies, and brownies.  I am just happy with my jalapeño chips though and really haven't tried the other items.

Unfortunately the staff seems to get quite overwhelmed with the lunch rush, doesn't seem like they're very used to it by the looks on their faces and the frantic-ness felt around that time.

Then there are two middle aged employees that usually work during the day that are very sloppy when making a sandwich. They're friendly enough but that doesn't make my sandwich taste good. I prefer to go when the two young guys are working but it doesn't always work that way.

However, this store became the exception to my rule this week. I went at lunch time so it was understandably busy but I wasn't greeted or acknowledged until I was served. I order the vegetarian sandwich. This is where my visit went downhill. This particular location only has one meat/cheese cutter--which means that the meat AND the cheese are sliced on the same machine--which means that even their \"vegetarian sandwich\" is going to have meat goo on it. BUMMER. This is a deal breaker for me but because I had already waited so long to be served I didn't have time to go anywhere else to get food. As I was checking out, I was charged for the avocado I asked for on my sandwich even though it states on the menu that it is included. The less-than-helpful cashier argued with me about it and at the end, I still ended up getting charged. Absolutely, positively will not be returning to this location.","user_id":76}

Looked up their menu before I went on lunch to get an idea of the food and saw they had a 'pilgrim griller'. Turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce all on a piece of bread? UHM yes please. I basically cram my thanksgiving dinner into rolls anyways (bread is a great vessel for shoving large amounts of food into ones mouth) so it would be like a little thanksgiving dinner for me. \n\nWalked in at 1 pm on a Thursday. Only one guy sitting there and it was nice and quiet. Ordered my pilgrim on sourdough with provolone, lettuce, *thinly sliced* pickle, tomatoes, olive, peppers and pepper. Took one bite and fell in love. The combo of sagey stuffing with the thin turkey and veggies and the sweet cranberries and tangy (fresh) sourdough bread definitely hit the spot! I got a medium which was HUGE. More than enough food if you order chips and a drink too.\n\nOverall not a bad place for lunch that's close to work and pretty cheap on the wallet and I will definitely be back for the pilgrim (damn limited time only bs)!","user_id":79}

Meats and cheeses were each cut fresh on the deli slicer. I had a choice of breads and chose sourdough which I thought was pretty good. This place seems to have your standard sub options for toppings but I'm boring so I never take full notice of the toppings because I never take full advantage of them. I noticed the guy in front of me, who I think was also an employee, getting a wrap so I guess it's a good sign that an employee is willing to pay and eat the food there. Service was friendly and I was in and out quickly.\n\nMy particular sandwich was $8 for a 12 inch. Not too bad. It's been a while since I've been to Blimpie but I'm thinking it's around the same price point and a little cheaper than a Jersey Mikes, all of which got their start in New Jersey (take that Jersey haters!). To me it's worth it to drop the extra $3 and have a sandwich that tastes like a sandwich and not something that's been peed on in the Subway.\n\nSo far so good and I hope they do well.\n\nOther info:\n\nWhen talking to the manager I was told that this particular store is corporate owned and not franchised.\n\nWhile I've never had a problem stopping for a sandwich at this place in the evening (as either a quizno's or port of subs) it can get kinda hectic around lunch as the parking lot is pretty darn tiny.","user_id":79}

However, I came to find out that this is Subway kicked up a notch!\n\nFirst, I was VERY pleased to see the sticker in the window that they have a new tuna melt griller sandwich.  YUM.  That's exactly what I wanted, and it's exactly what I got.  It was quite tasty.  I'm not sure what the cheese was, but it was delish.  Plenty of tuna and put on all the fixins I wanted (like jalapenos, mmm, my mouth is watering).\n\nI loved that they had a \"medium\" option (small = 5 inches, medium = 8, large = 12).\n\nThe line was HUGE and since this place isn't really convenient to get into (kind of an akward spot right off the freeway) I'm assuming that all their sandwiches are tasty to get that many people lining up for them.\n\nHubby got a cold sandwich (turkey & pastrami I think?) and liked it too.\n\nNow that I know I can get tasty wiches here, I'll be a regular here for sure.\n\nOnly complaint, a \"little\" pricey for a sub (like $6-7 for a medium) but I think it was still worth it.\n\np.s. they have breakfast sandwiches!

Not only do you get a good sandwich every time but also such a clean location to eat at if you wish. Has a very friendly, younger staff who does thier best to make your sandwich the way you'd like it. Now with that being said and the main reason i eat there (besides i live in Anthem).....this owner gives back to the community....not only does he support our local high schools but everything kids do in our area he supports. Whether it be soccer.....baseball....lacross....football...etc, he has no problem donating not only food but also sponsors teams....why would you go to anyone else ?I cant even count the times where he says \"just a sandwich...here,take this cup on me\" Not alot of business owners like this around anymore because of this economy. Im lucky to have this place in my neighborhood and will continue to spend my hard earned money there !!","user_id":88}

Came here for a couple sandwiches on a Saturday evening. There were two workers, a guy and a girl. The guy was talking to himself while making the sandwiches. The girl came from out of the back to help. My order could not be completed as requested as the guy said they only had two slices of American cheese. He put the two slices back from where he took them after putting them on the sandwich.\n\nAs the girl was putting lettuce on the sandwiches she must have put 3 full cups on each. The guy and her were having an extremely difficult time making and finishing these sandwiches. We were the only 2 customers in the building. I finally had to ask the guy if the two of them were baked or on drugs. He got defensive and hostile, but it seemed that he was expecting it. \n\nFinally, upon checking out I told the girl I wanted the receipt. She made a motion as if she had put it in the bag, then switched it to her other hand and put it on the left side of the register. I looked in the bag when I picked it up and said I don't see a receipt in here. She proceeded to frantically do a reprint of the receipt. It did not have the cashier name or proof that the transaction was paid by our credit card. I assume that this fiasco was an attempt to keep us from complaining. I would have let it go and left it as an amusing side show had the girl not tried to dupe me with the receipt.\n\nIn addition, it did not look like the containers were labeled and dated for freshness. The two did not know how old the avocado slices were. The guy was conversing with the girl, blaming it on the morning/afternoon employee and said if the avocados were still there in the morning then toss them. How health code and sanitary savvy. We didn't eat the sandwich with avocados. Went to the trash. The guy also made a comment to the girl about the things he had left to do in the back and said something about getting some me or happy time with a hand gesture.  I don't think I need to elaborate any further on that because it was pretty easy to infer what was going on. \n\n\nMessage to the owner; I don't care what your employees are doing on the clock if it does not pose a health risk to me, but you should care deeply how they represent your establishment and company good will. \n\nHere is the receipt info so that in the event you do not know what is going on in your establishment and would like to keep your clientele you can address these two fine model employees:\n\nPort of subs 92\n2642 horizon\n702 914 8288\nTicket #136 IN\nAmmount $15.06 \nPayment: charge\n6455 20:25 #01 AUG.30'14 REG0001","user_id":88}
